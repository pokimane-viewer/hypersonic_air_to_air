# hypersonic_air_to_air and demo solve small linear system with numpy

Is this correct? I'm not sure but it's homework time finally! Upgrading the PL-15’s propulsion system offers a pathway to maintain a decisive advantage in air combat, especially as countermeasures and opposing missile systems evolve.

# loyal wingmen who fly ahead of Pete?

Among the options, **air-breathing propulsion** (either air-augmented rockets or full ramjet sustainers) stands out for its ability to greatly enhance range and endgame maneuverability – as evidenced by the Meteor missile’s performance. These technologies would transform the PL-15 from a high-speed interceptor to more of a “miniature cruise missile,” capable of sustained powered flight and intelligent energy management.

# But that seems hallucinatory garabage for at best, if I could even remove a hidden soldiered on Intel or whatever mobile SoC

 On the other hand, **incremental upgrades** like improved dual-pulse motors and better propellants should not be overlooked: they leverage existing designs and manufacturing infrastructure for smaller but meaningful gains in performance. 

 # Are you able to think of upgrades to make manually without the aid of computation?

  In either case, **advanced computational design** is the linchpin enabling these upgrades. By using GPU-accelerated CFD, FEA, and optimization algorithms, engineers can push the design envelope with confidence, identifying the best concepts and refining them before committing to hardware.

# I'll get results somehow but it adds a lot of non-casually masked attention to well a solve me plz so it can work well, and required here

# when you manually search it's got temperature I assume they set it to a lower value with gemini deep research then write a nice report!

I'm expecting some nice hallucinations; I'm curious if there's 1 usably direct or cognitively direct..

# This veru very old and will not calculate real upgrades, is a simple demo of the PL15 weapons system in full. 

The previous simple computationally aided design source code attempts to optimize rocket flight performance (velocity, distance, delta-V) by systematically iterating over thrust, Isp, and burn time. It calculates a custom delta-V or performance metric and uses a stepwise simulation of flight to account for drag, mass changes, and other factor

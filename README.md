This computationally aided design source code attempts to optimize rocket flight performance (velocity, distance, delta-V) by systematically iterating over thrust, Isp, and burn time. It calculates a custom delta-V or performance metric and uses a stepwise simulation of flight to account for drag, mass changes, and other factor
